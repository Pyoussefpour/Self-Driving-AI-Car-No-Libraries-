what has been done do far?
- there is a neural network that is able to drive the car
-  the nueral network is not trained and cannot learn from the data 

what is the next step?
- train the neural network to learn from the data 
- use an RL algorithm to train the neural network, code it in js
- upload to github, with the modificaitons
- add more cars, randomly generated
    - cars can't be in the same place
    - maybe varrying speed


- later on maybe add a curved road





NN:
0 - nothing
1 - up
2 - up + left
3 - up + right
