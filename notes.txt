what has been done do far?
- there is a neural network that is able to drive the car
-  the nueral network is not trained and cannot learn from the data 

what is the next step?
- train the neural network to learn from the data 
- use an RL algorithm to train the neural network, code it in js
- upload to github, with the modificaitons
- add more cars, randomly generated
    - cars can't be in the same place
    - maybe varrying speed

- have a finish line, to end the episode

- later on maybe add a curved road

TODO: Randomize Traffic - done
TODO: Maybe make the win look for exciting

RL
TODO: Do it with 50 AI bots (with the same network) -> look into batch learning with drl
